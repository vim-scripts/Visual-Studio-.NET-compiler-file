I use big Visual Studio .NET projects at work.  With .NET microsoft no longer supports exported project make files so nmake is dead for my purpoeses and I have to call devenv ( like so set makeprg=devenv\ project.vcproj\ -build\ debug). 

The errorformat of devenv is a bit different from the old vc6 build tool, so here's a script with the error format in.

This could actually get more elaborate, a buildproject script that took a project name as a parameter and build the apropiate  set makeprg= command and executes it could be done, but I'm in a hurry.
